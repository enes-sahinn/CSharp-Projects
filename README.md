### [Chemical Equations](../master/Chemical-Equations)

A C# program that takes a chemical formulation as a single string from the user and prints whether the left and right parts of the string are tantamount or not. 

- The chemical formulation can only include two chemical elements: C (Carbon) and H (Hydrogen). 
- The chemical formulation can only include sum operation (+).      (not other mathematical operations such as - and *)
- The chemical formulation can only include C, c, H, h, +, =, and digits.  (not other characters such as #, &, !)
